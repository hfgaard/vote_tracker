This app allows you to vote on the cutest kitten given 2 pictures of kittens. It displays the number of votes each kitten currently has and allows the user to vote as many as times as they wish by pressing the "VS" button.

I started by creating the basic HTML that has the name of the page, information about how to vote, a button that will separate the two pictures and placeholders for the two pictures to be added later. I then used CSS to style the page with the skeleton grid system. Then I used JavaScript and jQuery to add the ability to add and update the images on the page. This also updates the votes when the user clicks on the picture they are voting on. Finally, it adds in a class to the HTML that styles the background of the image the user is voting on, so that it is differentiated from the other image.
